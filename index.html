			<p>Our class at Light and Truth Montessori consists of a mixed age group 3 to 6 year olds. This grouping enables children to learn from and help each other. Practical life activities such as buttoning, pouring, and washing enable the young child to acquire a wide range of skills necessary in building the child’s self-confidence. The basic readiness skills and concepts necessary for reading, writing, and math are developed in a broadly based program which includes science, outdoor education, movement, social studies and geography.</p>

			<p>We have a beautiful classroom with several areas. Practical Life, Sensorial, Mathematics, Science, Reading, Art, and Music. <a href="#visit">Contact us</a> to schedule a visit to our classroom. We know that your child will enjoy Light and Truth Montessori Montessori as we prepare them for a lifetime love of learning and exploring.</p>

			<h1 class="section__title">Why Montessori?</h1>
			
			<p>Montessori education offers our children opportunities to develop their potential as they step out into the world as engaged, competent, responsible, and respectful citizens with an understanding and appreciation that learning is for life.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Each child is valued as a unique individual.</strong> Montessori education recognizes that children learn in different ways, and accommodates all learning styles. Students are also free to learn at their own pace, each advancing through the curriculum as he is ready, guided by the teacher and an individualized learning plan.</li>
				<li><strong>Beginning at an early age, Montessori students develop order, coordination, concentration, and independence.</strong> Classroom design, materials, and daily routines support the individual’s emerging “self-regulation” (ability to educate one’s self, and to think about what one is learning), toddlers through adolescents.</li>
				<li><strong>Students are part of a close, caring community.</strong> The multi-age classroom—typically spanning 3 years—re-creates a family structure. Older students enjoy stature as mentors and role models; younger children feel supported and gain confidence about the challenges ahead. Teachers model respect, loving kindness, and a belief in peaceful conflict resolution.</li>
				<li><strong>Montessori students enjoy freedom within limits.</strong> Working within parameters set by their teachers, students are active participants in deciding what their focus of learning will be. Montessorians understand that internal satisfaction drives the child’s curiosity and interest and results in joyous learning that is sustainable over a lifetime.</li>
				<li><strong>Students are supported in becoming active seekers of knowledge.</strong> Teachers provide environments where students have the freedom and the tools to pursue answers to their own questions.</li>
				<li><strong>Self-correction and self-assessment are an integral part of the Montessori classroom approach.</strong> As they mature, students learn to look critically at their work, and become adept at recognizing, correcting, and learning from their errors.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Given the freedom and support to question, to probe deeply, and to make connections, Montessori students become confident, enthusiastic, self-directed learners. They are able to think critically, work collaboratively, and act boldly—a skill set for the 21st century.</p>
